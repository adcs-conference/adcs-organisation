# Things you might want to know when running ADCS

Andrew Trotman, Paul Thomas, Andrew Turpin, Laurianne Sitbon December 2013

## Introduction

This document is a brain dump of stuff you might like to know if
you’re going to chair ADCS.

The first thing you need to know is that the previous chairs are all
very nice people and are willing to help you.

The detailed information in the document (budget mainly) is
for 2013. Please refer to previous versions of this document for 2012
information.

## Governance

For the purpose of interacting with external bodies the “sponsor” as
the ACM call it, or the “governing body” is the ADCS host institute
(your university).  This is because ADCS is an ad hoc organisation and
not a legal body but ACM requires a legal body.  Your university is
it.

ADCS does have a constitution.  It was written by Justin Zobel and is
as follows:

> An outgoing Chair becomes a steering committee member. Anyone who has
> served for 6 years steps down and becomes an honorary member. An
> honorary member can be invited to become a member for another period
> by the existing steering committee. Where there leads to more than two
> members per institution, we will ask whether any of these members
> wishes to step aside, so that no one institution is overrepresented.

Each year there is a conference chair, an incoming PC chair, and an
outgoing PC chair.

An agreed member acts as a secretary.  There is no chair.  The role of
the secretary is to

- Maintain this list of roles
- Keep track of the steering committee membership
- Remember to initiate the headhunt for a new conference chair and incoming PC chair each year
- Regularly circulate the list of roles to chairs and committee members

The role of the steering committee is to oversee the conference, specifically,

- Choose an incoming PC chair each year
- Approve the program committee proposed by the PC chairs
- Approve the list of conference topics proposed by the PC chairs
- Approve the choice of invited speaker
- Approve any special arrangements that might be suggested
- Receive an annual briefing from the PC chairs
- Choosing the location

The roles of the PC chairs include

- Issuing calls-for-papers
- Managing all aspects of the reviewing process, including software
- Identifying candidate PC members and invited speakers
- Liaising with the general Chairs

The history of membership is

(2012) secretary. Andrew Turpin has been the (unelected) president
since 2011.

## ACM SIGIR in-cooperation status

It is essential that in-cooperation status is gained before the
application to the ACM digital library commences. If not then the
in-cooperation application will be rejected.

In order to apply, it is essential that at least one of the co-chairs
is an ACM/SIGIR member.

Application for in-cooperation status starts with a request to the
SIGIR vice-chair (vc_SIGIR@acm.org). (Note this is a different request
than the one for sponsorship. For sponsorship, see the later section
on the topic). This should be done “6-12 months before the event”
according to the SIGIR web site. The email I sent included the
following text:

> I am emailing you today to request in-cooperation status for the 2013
> edition of the Australasian Document Computing Symposium, to be held
> in Brisbane, Australia, on the 5th and 6th of December 2013.
> 
> We are a scientific conference specializing in Document Computing.  We
> draw ouraudience from Australasia, and our review panel is from the
> same region. We are a symposium drawing an audience of between 30 and
> 50 each year.  The steering committee for 2013 is:
> 
> James Thom
> Andrew Turpin
> Andrew Trotman
> Paul Thomas
> Falk Scholer
> Mark Sanderson
> Sally Jo Cunningham
> Laurianne Sitbon
> Shlomo Geva (ADCS Secretary)
> 
> I think this is a strong IR presence. In 2013 I am the general chair
> as well a one of the PC co-chairs along with Shane Culpepper (RMIT)
> and Guido Zuccon (CSIRO).
> 
> Full papers are 8 pages short papers are 4 pages. We are going to use
> the ACM format this year again because we are again looking for
> approval for inclusion into theDigital Library.  Single blind peer
> review is normal for ADCS, but we can do double blind if you prefer.
> With respect to acceptance rates, I quote from the 2012 conference
> report to appear in the SIGIR forum (December 2012) and attached to
> this email:
> 
> “In total 24 papers were submitted, and similar numbers have been seen
> for several years.  Each paper was, in full, single-blind reviewed by
> three independent qualified experts in the field.  Reviewing was at
> the normal high level expected at SIGIR supported academic events.
> From the 24 papers, 11 were accepted for full presentation and 8 were
> selected for short presentation and poster (poster boaster and
> poster).”
> 
> And I quote from the 2011 proceedings:
> 
> “Of 24 submitted papers, 10 were accepted for full presentation at the
> symposium (42%) and 5 were accepted as short papers (21%). The full
> written version of eachsubmission received at least two anonymous
> reviews by independent, qualified experts in the area; several
> received three reviews. Dual submissions were explicitly prohibited.”
> 
> With respect to benefits to SIGIR members, ADCS is already focused on
> IR, our papers will be in the ACM DL (more accessible to SIGIR
> members), the event will help bring the IR community here closer to
> the international IR community (and vice versa).  For us, we hope to
> draw from an international audience (papers and participants).  We
> have traditionally had NICTA and Google as financial contributors, and
> expect them to contribute again this year, but no doubt an ongoing
> co-cooperation status with SIGIR will help strengthen our relationship
> with them and others.
> 
> With respect to money, ADCS is not a legal entity, but rather an ad
> hoc committee.  This year QUT is the "sponsor" as ACM call it, and
> will not make profit on the conference.  The ADCS conferences do not
> make a profit, but run on a draw even basis.  Last year we carried
> near $600 to this year, which will go towards this year's costs.  We
> typically do not have a registration fee (and no publication or
> speaking fees either), in fact we normally try to spend any money (in
> and above running costs) on student travel support.  The typical
> agreement we have with Google is that all the money they give us will
> go on student travel to ADCS and any spare will go on student travel
> to ALTW (an NLP conference we typically co-locate with).
> 
> ADCS 2013 will be held in Brisbane, Australia, 5-6 December 2013.
> 
> Please see information below about the call for papers and committees,
> that will shortly be available on the website.
> 
> If you need any more information the please let me know. I realise
> that I am sending this request very close to the recommended
> anticipation of 6-12 month but hope this will not interfere with a
> decision.

Once the SIGIR executive committee approve the in-cooperation status
it is then necessary to make a formal application to the ACM.  The
final decision is made by ACM, not SIGIR.  To apply for ACM
in-cooperation status you must fill out a “Technical Meeting Request
Form”, known as a TMRF. They are online (along with guidelines) here:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/incoop

ACM use the term “sponsor” to refer to the governing body that
organises the conference.  As ADCS does not have a legal governing
body, I sought permission from my university for it to act as the
“sponsor” (they did).  ACM will not grant in-cooperation status if the
“sponsor” is a for-profit organisation.  This is not a problem for
must universities in Australasia. I believe that the “acronym” that
the ACM uses to identify ADCS is “ADCS”.

Application for in-cooperation status is two stage.  When you start
filling out the form you supply mostly factual information and it logs
what you have done.  Eventually you end up at a page that has two Word
documents to download and complete.  The ACM send you a URL to get
back to the middle-point in the form filling process.

The first is the “Statement of Understanding for ACM In-Cooperation
Conferences”.  This is essentially the “hold-harmless” clause that
says ADCS won’t sue the ACM, and that ADCS will behave nicely (by
doing stuff like putting the ACM logo on things).  For ADCS 2012 this
form was signed by the ADCS General Chair and the Head of Department
at the host institute.

The second form is the “Financial Responsibility Letter for use with
organizations that can not provide a Certificate of Insurance”.  The
letter used in ADCS 2012 contained a scan of the current insurance
documents of the University of Otago (obtained from my divisional
office). It was signed by a Dean, and contained the following text:
 
> MISSING
 
In 2013, the following was signed by the supporting head of school at QUT, and sent with current insurance documents. 

> Re: ADCS 2013 and he Association for Computing Machinery
> in-Cooperation
> 
> The Eighteenth Australasian Document Computing Symposium 2013 taking
> place on Thursday 5th – Friday 6h December, 2013 in Brisbane Australia
> is sponsored by us, the Queensland University of Technology.
> 
> We, the sponsors of this conference, take 100%financial
> responsibility, ACM and SIGIR hold no responsibility, financial or
> otherwise, for this conference.  We are unable to submit a current
> Certificate of Insurance for the period of the conference, as QUT’s
> insurance policies will be renewed as a matter of course commencing 1
> November 2013, pending acceptance of our proposal forms by the
> insurers.
> 
> Unfortunately, as you will appreciate, our Insurers will not provide
> Certificates of Currency that take our cover beyond 31 October 2013 as
> the insurance renewal agreement is currently under negotiation and has
> not yet been signed.
> 
> As soon as the relevant agreement has been accepted and signed, we
> will be in a position to provide you with a certificate of currency
> covering the relevant policies (Public Liability, Professional
> Indemnity, Corporate Travel and Personal Accident) for the period 1
> November 2013 to 31 October 2014. In the meantime, you will find
> attached the current certificate of insurance.

You submit the two forms and wait for the ACM to get back to you.  As
they contain signatures, PDF scans was the approach taken for ADCS
2012.

ACM logos are here:

## ACM Digital Library

*Application for SIGIR in-cooperation status must be done before any
application to the digital library.*

The ACM will issue you with the ISBN.

For ADCS 2012 and again in 2013 we applied to enter the Digital
Library under the “International Conference Proceedings Series”, the
IPCS program (see: http://www.acm.org/publications/icp_series).  From
what I recall, this was a relatively straightforward process of fact
gathering and form filling (quoted from Andrew in 2012, confirmed by
Laurianne in 2013)

**Important: make sure that the starting date indicated on the form is
  one day earlier than the actual commencement of ADCS, as the
  proceedings will appear on the first day of the conference US time
  (which will be around very late on the actual first day in
  Australasia…)**

The ACM rule about copyright transfer is that papers require copyright
transfer but abstracts do not.  ADCS published papers and so copyright
transfer is required. This should be made clear on the web site and
also on the call for papers as it was new for ADCS in 2012.

The ACM publication templates are here:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates

The conference management software used for ADCS 2012 and 2013 was
easychair, see here: http://easychair.org/. EasyChair was also used to
collect and generate the proceedings.

The call for papers used for ADCS contained the following text:


> EIGHTEENTH AUSTRALASIAN DOCUMENT COMPUTING SYMPOSIUM (ADCS 2013)
>  http://www.adcs2013.qut.edu.au/
> 
> IMPORTANT DATES
> 7 Oct 2013 - Submission deadline
> 21 Oct 2013 - Notification of acceptance / rejection
> 4 Nov 2013 - Final camera ready due
> 5/6 Dec 2013 - ADCS in Brisbane, Australia
> 
> LOCATION
> Brisbane, Australia
> 
> AIM OF THE SYMPOSIUM
> 
> ADCS2013 is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners in
> document management and information retrieval to meet and present
> their work. The symposium aims to cover all aspects of Document
> Computing - issues ranging from the fundamentals of document
> architectures and standards for markup, through storage, management,
> retrieval, authentication and workflow, to active and virtual
> documents. The symposium emphasises both commercial and academic
> issues by encouraging a variety of submissions.
> 
> TOPICS OF INTEREST
> The symposium topics include (but are not restricted to) the following:
> 
> Cognitive Aspects of Documents
> Digital Libraries
> Document Databases
> Document Management
> Document Standards (XML, SGML, etc.)
> Document Workflow
> Information Retrieval
> Multimedia Document Management
> Multimedia Resource Discovery
> Natural Language Techniques and Documents
> Personalised Documents
> User Studies Involving Documents
> Web Documents
> 
> SUBMISSIONS
> 
> All submissions must be original work, not previously published
> elsewhere, and not currently submitted to any other conference or
> journal. Electronic copies of accepted papers will be made available
> through the ACM Digital Library as part of the ICPS
> collection. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically, in PDF
> format and formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available
> at: http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates. Full
> papers have a maximum of length of 8 pages including all references,
> and short papers have a maximum length of 4 pages including
> references. All submissions will be fully refereed using a single
> blind refereeing process, at their full published length, and will
> comply with DEST criteria for fully-refereed conference papers
> (category E1). Papers will be submitted using Easy Chair. See
> Submissions for more information.
> 
> Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that,
> should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend
> the symposium to present the work. Note also that it is insufficient
> for an author to register and pay for the symposium to be regarded as
> fulfilling this obligation.  Authors of accepted papers will have to
> sign the ACM rights management form to comply with publication in the
> ACM digital library. For more information see the ACM authors page.
> 
> FULL PAPERS
> 
> Full papers should describe new contributions or analyse research
> issues. Submissions should be at most eight pages long (around 4000
> words); over-length submissions risk immediate rejection. Refer to the
> guidelines for papers for details of the required format.
> 
> POSTERS, SHORT PAPERS AND INDUSTRY STATUS REPORTS
> 
> To encourage participation by industry and to provide a place for work
> of a more speculative nature, ADCS invites submissions for short
> papers, up to a maximum of four pages (around 2000 words). A typical
> proposal might describe a leading-edge solution to a practical problem
> in document management. Short papers follow the same format as for

In 2012 the call was distributed for the following lists:
ntcir@nii.ac.jp, inex@lists.mmci.uni-saarland.de, clef@dei.unipd.it,
ir@jiscmail.ac.uk, irlist@lists.shef.ac.uk, irnet@dcs.gla.ac.uk,
asis-l@asis.org, ischoolsweb@ischools.org, corpora@uib.no,
doceng@yahoogroups.com, alta-announce@googlegroups.com.
It was lodged with DBWorld here: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/dbworld/post.html 
In 2013 it was also included on WikiCFP. 

In 2013 we also set up a Twitter account for ADCS:
AusDocCompSymp. Refer to Guido Zuccon (Guido.Zuccon@csiro.au) for
access credentials.

ADCS also has a Facebook Group:
 http://www.facebook.com/bookmarks/groups#!/groups/402943569728256/
 Generally, if you are too slow putting news there, Andrew Trotman
 will do it for you ☺.

These, with regular news on the website, are great ways to acknowledge
sponsors as soon as they agree to support ADCS.

The review process is the same as for any other conference. Once the
final selection has been made its necessary to inform the ACM by
submitting a list of type of paper/author / title / corresponding
author.  This step is normally done by the PC Chairs, and involves
emailing Craig Rodkin at the ACM (rodkin@hq.acm.org) the list in csv
format, according to the instructions on the ICPS website. The list
can be generated by combining the main list of authors (for the
corresponding author) from easychair as well as the list of accepted
papers. In 2013 we didn’t find any more straighforward approach to
gather all the informtion. The ACM provides a URL that can be used to
monitor who has and has not completed he copyright clearance form. In
2013 there was a series of editing issues with the actual description
of the proceedings. Make sure to include Craig Rodkin in all
communications at this stage.

Once an author completed the ACM copyright form they are automatically
emailed a message that contains the correct text to use in the
copyright box at the bottom of column one on page one.  Note that the
message is not the same for all papers. It can differ based on some
governments not allowing copyright transfer and it can differ if a
paper contains other already copyrighted materials (such as an image).

Once all the copyright forms are completed and the camera ready PDFs
are available from the conference management software (EasyChair),
download the PDFs and rename them according to the the ACM
instructions (last name of first author, userscore, start page
number). I suggest ADCS uses a paper number approach rather than a
page number approach – once in the ACM digital library the
distribution of a single “proceedings of” PDF is nearly pointless.
However, the front matter (preface, and credits) remain important and
the ACM will put these into the Digital library.

The preface used in 2012 was the following text (future years should
remember to thank invited speakers):

> Chair’s Preface
> 
> These proceedings contain the papers presented at ADCS 2013, the
> Eighteenth Australasian Document Computing Symposium, hosted by the
> Queensland University of Technology and held in Brisbane, Queensland,
> Australia.
> 
> The quality of submissions was again very high this year. Of the 23
> papers submitted, 12 were accepted for full presentation at the
> symposium and 5 were accepted for short presentation The full written
> version of each submission received at least three anonymous reviews
> by independent, qualified international experts in the area. Dual
> submissions were explicitly prohibited. The accepted contributions
> cover a diverse range of topics in document computing, including
> efficiency, evaluation, enterprise search, use of social media for
> crisis management, information retrieval models and text
> classifications.
> 
> The symposium includes many formal presentations which allow a long
> time for questions and discussions, but also many opportunities to
> share ideas during interactive sessions and informal gatherings. This
> benefit is certainly the greatest for document computing
> practitioners. Once again we have collocated with the Australasian
> Language Technology Workshop (ALTA), sharing a keynote talk, a joint
> paper session, a poster session, and social events.
> 
> We would like to thank the members of the program committee for their
> thorough reviewing efforts. We would also like to thank ACM SIGIR,
> Bing, the Australian e-Health Research Centre (with CSIRO),
> Funnelback, and the Queensland University of Technology for their
> generous support of the event. We would also like to warmly thank the
> international keynote speakers who have accepted to come and share
> with the ADCS community for the time of the symposium. Finally, we
> thank all attendees of ADCS 2013 who made the trip to Brisbane.

It is essential to include the number of submitted and accepted papers
and the ACM want this information.  Please remember to thank the
invited spears (apologies for not doing so in 2012).

ZIP the papers, the ADCS logo, the invited talk abstracts, the
preface, and the organisers lists and upload them to the ACM site.  In
2012 the URL was: ftp://pubftp.acm.org.  the ACM will send you an
email with the login details. If not the contact Craig Rodkin
(rodkin@hq.acm.org).  Once you submit the ZIP file email Craig Rodkin
(rodkin@hq.acm.org) to tell him they are there.

The ACM need the ZIP file to be given to them three weeks before the
first day of the conference.  This affects the ADCS schedules and
makes the review process tight, but not impossible.

In 2012 we did not print the proceedings, we did not make CD-ROMs, and
we did not distribute USB keys.  We simply relied on download.  There
we no complaints.  This approach not only saves money (that can
consequently be given to students) but also saves hours of work.  As
the USA (i.e. ACM) are one day behind New Zealand we did host a single
PDF for download on the ADCS web site from late afternoon the day
before ADCS until early morning the day after (the ACM is trying to
fix this for ADCS and other events).  Discussion at ADCS 2012
suggested that the ACM were unlikely to be unhappy with limited time
password-controlled access to a downloadable PDF of the ADCS
proceedings hosted on the ACM web site.  Participants certainly do
want copies during the event, and many found the ADCS 2012 proceedings
before the URL was announced at the conference opening.

In 2013 we decided to go with very cheap and small USB keys. It all
depends on the budget, but we thought it was a safer approach than
only relying on downloads. The USBs were ordered already loaded from a
company called RBP for a total price of $272.23 and delivered in 2
days.


## Budget
The budget for 2013 is still not quite closed. The tables below are in AUD. 

### Income
Income came from few sources:


Who         | Amount     | For Contact                                       |
------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------
CSIRO       | $1,000     | Keynote Speaker airfaires                         | Guido Zuccon
QUT-IFE     | $1,000     | Cocktail for poster session                       | L. Sitbon
Bing        | $1,335.00  | Catering                                          | Nick Craswell
Funnelback  | $100.00    | Best Paper Award                                  | David Hawking
SIGIR       | $5,000.00  | Travel for students and Catering and other stuff  | Diane Kelly
TOTAL       | $8,873.70  |                                                   |


Note that Google and NICTA sponsored in 2012 (2,500 each) but not in 2013. 

Google pay a lump sum. When ADCS first contacted Google (for ADCS
2011) we promised that the money would be used for student travel and
no other purpose.  We also told Google that should we be unable to
spend all their contribution the remainder would go on student travel
to ALTA.  Our contact there is Sally-Ann Williams
(sallyann@google.com). We have in previous year send Google a list of
the names of the students they helped fund – and this means getting
this information from ALTA when ADCS subsidises ALTA.

NICTA paid a lump sum in 2012, and did not sponsor in 2013.  I am not
aware of any restrictions on the use of the NICA contribution.  Our
contact there is a 5 (annette.mcleod@nicta.com.au).  Note that in
2013, they offered to pay for a keynote’s travel (Diane Kelly) with
the condition they would spend some time in Canberra. Unfortunately by
the time it was arranged financially she was no longer available.

Bing paid a lump sum. Bing sponsored ADCS for the first time in 2012.
They agreed to cover the cost of catering up-to $1,335.00 (which was
the catering cost of ADCS 2011).  Microsoft Research no longer
sponsors ADCS (effective from 2011).  Our contact at Bing is Nick
Craswell (nickcr@microsoft.com), a frequent ADCS attendee. He is not
very good at answering his email and so I strongly suggest that he is
contacted by someone who knows him personally. From 2014 onwards, I
would suggest you contact David Hawking also.

Funnelback started sponsoring the best paper award since it
started 2012.  The $100 directly to the winner of the award. David
Hawking (David.Hawking@funnelback.com) is the contact person.  He is a
frequent ADCS author and participant. He may know who to contact from
2014 onwards.

SIGIR sponsorship started in 2012.  SIGIR has what it calls “friends
of SIGIR”, little conferences that is can help by providing financial
assistance. The SIGIR secretary administers the fund and up-to (I
think) $5,000 can be applied for.  SIGIR prefers the application
coming from their Asia-Pacific representative. In 2013, Andrew Trotman
was still this “representative” although only through his position as
a secretary. The actual official representative was Testua Sakai who
was never approached on this particular matter. ADCS 2013 requested
$5,000 to cover student travel ($2,000) and catering expenses ($3,000)
and other items such as keynote speakers gifts and usb drives.  SIGIR
administered the travel fund themselves and send cash for the rest. We
agreed to write a workshop paper for SIGIR Forum in order to secure
their sponsorship.  Doing so is good publicity for ADCS.

We haven’t contacted DSTO in 2013 but it could have been a good idea. 

## Expenses

There was 50 participants registered for ADCS 2013 (including around 6
also registered to ALTA).  The expenses for 2013 were a little complex
because catering was shared with ALTA. We had to juggle with different
numbers of participants and shared participants, but I think it was
worthwhile from a community point of you. Also there was only one
local chair for both conferences anyway…. So unit costs for Catering
are for information only as payments were shared differently. Also the
$1,000 sponsorship from QUT was for both conferences so it was set
apart.

Campus Catering was contracted for tea / coffee breaks.  Lunch was
Guzman and Gomez burritos on the first day, and Subway platters on the
second day ($55 each).  Drinks were cans of coke / sprite and bottled
water purchased from them.  While in 2013 we didn’t need poster boards
hire and delivery, it may be necessary to account for in the budget
for other years.

Student travel support varied from students to student based on
personal circumstances, but also on the initial budget. The $2,000
specifically requested for student travel from SIGIR was managed
directly by them, and the rest by us (that is, QUT’s finance
department). As a result, the allocation of the $2,000 had been made
for 2 international students and could not change when the budget
grew. The allocation made for NZ and Australian student could be
upgraded with the additional budget since we managed these
funds. Unless you have a very large budget early on (in which case you
can just fully fund everyone at their request), I don’t really see
many easier ways to manage this. The students were funded on the basis
of 2 nights in budget accommodation ($100) and the price of flights at
the time of decision on papers. They were reminded of this when
requesting the grant.  Only 4 students requested a grant in 2013, and
we decided to support all of them not fully (as per the initial
budget) rather than not funding everyone. There was no consideration
of the type of paper they were presenting, and 2 of them presented
posters.

Substitute student sponsorship into the expenses, subtract that from
income leaves profit.  Recall that ADCS does not intend to make
profit.  The carryover from 2013 to 2014 is currently estimated to
$591.01

ADCS does not have a bank account.  ADCS 2013 did not have a
registration fee (ADCS has had no fee for several years, and there is
actually a cost in getting the registration money, and QUT would have
charged room hire even if we had a minimal registration fee).

It is convention for academic institutes to have a room charge for
conferences. It is also convention for them to waive it for true
academic conferences chaired by members of their faculty.


## Keynote Speakers

As much as you can, try and organise keynote speakers very early
on. If they are in the northern hemisphere, I would recommend early
September at the latest as they have to organise their semester. It
can be quite tricky as inviting them might depend on sponsorship that
might not come very early, but then if you invite them too late (as we
did in 2013) they may already have other obligations. In 2013, we
invited, Diane Kelly, Doug Oard and Tetsua Sakai who all said they
would have been delighted to come but unfortunately had other
obligations.

## ADCS and ALTA

ADCS and ALTA are normally co-hosted.  ATLA has a formal executive
which is listed on their web site.

In 2013 ALTA and ADCS were run as parallel sessions.  This was very
effective with exchange between the two events occurring.  This was as
simple as a agreeing on the coffee-break and lunch times and how many
papers were seen in each session. We actually established our program
first and sent it to them so that they followed our template. We had
to be a little careful with people having papers in both conferences,
especially not to have all their papers ending up in the shared
session.

There is normally a joint ADCS / ALTA full-paper session with 2 papers
from each conference (for a total of 4) presented in the one session.
In 2012 a shared poster session was trialled an was very effective
with active exchange between the two events. It was done again very
successfully in 2013.

## Other Stuff

Remember, each PC chair agrees to stand for 2 years.  One new PC chair
is added each year, so institutional knowledge is passed from the old
PC chair to the new PC chair.

Choose a venue early on (and a date too).  People need to know where
and when ADCS will be.

Recommend two levels of accommodation: one suitable for students and
the other suitable for faculty.

Find a venue for the conference dinner that accepts individual
payments (unless you find enough sponsorship to pay for everyone’s
dinner!)

## Brief Check List

This list is not comprehensive – its just what fell into the minds of
those who read the drafts of this document.

### January-February
- Choose a venue and dates (agreed with ALTA and with ADCS steering comittee)
- Establish a website (chose a stable location)
- Set up a financial account in your university (QUT had a special rule where we needed a waiver so that they would not take overheads on income)
- Arrange venue hire
- Secure sponsorship (NICTA, Google, Bing, CSIRO, Funnelback)

### March-June
- Secure SIGIR in-cooperation status (via SIGIR then ACM)
- Apply for entry in the ACM Digital library
- Secure sponsorship (NICTA, Google, Bing, SIGIR, CSIRO Funnelback), if you haven’t started already. 

### June-October
- Arrange Keynote Speakers (with PC Chairs)
- Send out calls for papers early and often
- Set up registration system (I Recommend to set up a date early enough to be able to have reliable numbers early on, in 2013 we were a bit too late)

### September - October
- Arrange Wi-Fi Access
- Arrange catering (tea, coffee, lunches)
- Book dinner venue
- Recommend accommodation (try and find deals where possible)

### October-November
- Liaise with PC Chairs to make sure the proceedings are going ok (if you are not a PC chair anyway)
- Order name badges and USBs
- Organise the programme with the PC chairs (set constraints where necessary)
- Prepare and print a booklet (at least with maps and wifi information)

### On the days before the conference:
- Confirm catering numbers (order now if from subway or Guzman and Gomez).
- Print and prepare name badges
- Print Wi-Fi codes (as required)
- Print and arrange signage
- Organise tables for registration desk and catering (at QUT we had to litteraly invite them via Outlook Calendar ;))


## Final advice

Enjoy yourself and do it your way.
